/**
 * Cron: Send Appointment Reminders
 *
 * Emails customers whose Confirmed appointment starts within the next 24
 * hours and hasn't been reminded yet (appointments.reminder_sent). Meant to
 * run periodically from the command line, e.g. every 30-60 minutes via
 * Windows Task Scheduler or cron -- it is NOT web-exposed on purpose, since
 * an unauthenticated HTTP endpoint that mass-emails customers on request
 * would be an abuse vector.
 *
 * SMS isn't wired up yet -- no provider account/API key exists (Semaphore is
 * the common choice for PH numbers) -- so sendAppointmentReminderSms() below
 * only logs what would have been sent. Customers reachable only by SMS (no
 * linked user account/email, e.g. most guest bookings) are intentionally
 * left with reminder_sent = 0 so a future SMS-capable run can still pick
 * them up; customers who opted out of email (notify_email = 0) are marked
 * handled since there's currently no other channel to try.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php backend/cron/sendAppointmentReminders.php
